Start experimenting with short time series
- Julian day take variance around the estimated means for the calculated climatologies
- Experiment with the three different lengths
- Then look at RMSE against the known 30 year climatology
- Do this ofr all of the different arguments for the default climatology methodology

- Then do all of these same steps for the Fourrier transformation

Start experimenting with missing data
- When do consecutive mising days start to have a serious effect

Start experimenting on how short time series affect default detection
- Do they dissapear?
- How might they change?

Eventually start getting gridded data
- Compare pixels to see how detection differs between products
- What parameters must be changed and why to optimise our confidence in detection between products
