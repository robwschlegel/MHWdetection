Before compiling:
- Check that the word 'event' is not used incorrectly
- Check that 'doy' is always in '' marks
- Check that the words 'will' and 'may' and 'decadal' and 'seen' are only used in very specific situations
- Check that 'maximum' is used instead of 'max'
- Ensure that 'average' is used instead of 'collective'

- Make sure that the issue of the long-term trend confusion w.r.t. anthropogenic version decadal oscilation has been addressed
- Make sure a sentence has been added to the methods explaining that the 90% CI is used to measure the range of values per sub-optimal step
  - Also explaining the use of R2 values to show linearity in the response
- Methods needs another pass to ensure that the focus results: count, sum of duration, and mean max intensity is better outlined up front
  - Specifically the concept of MHW days as a measure of the sum of durations needs to be laid out
  - This is probably best to do in the first paragraph
- Ensure that figure legends reflect the changes to the figures
  - Specifically make sure that the grey 'average' lines are explained
- Double check all numbers in the results
- The sentences explaining why the global pattern figures for missing and trend tests are in the supp need to be re-worked
- Need to check the relationship between the Var clim value and the change in the MHW results when a time series is lengthened past 30 years
- Check that Supplemntary is used correctly
- Final check of References
