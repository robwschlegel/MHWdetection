abstract = {Significant changes in physical and biological systems are occurring on all continents and in most oceans, with a concentration of available data in Europe and North America. Most of these changes are in the direction expected with warming temperature. Here we show that these changes in natural systems since at least 1970 are occurring in regions of observed temperature increases, and that these temperature increases at continental scales cannot be explained by natural climate variations alone. Given the conclusions from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report that most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-twentieth century is very likely to be due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations, and furthermore that it is likely that there has been significant anthropogenic warming over the past 50 years averaged over each continent except Antarctica, we conclude that anthropogenic climate change is having a significant impact on physical and biological systems globally and in some continents.},

@article{Barsugli1998,
abstract = {Starting from the assumption that the atmosphere is the primary source of variability internal to the midlatitude atmosphere-ocean system on intraseasonal to interannual timescales, the authors construct a simple stochastically forced, one-dimensional, linear, coupled energy balance model. The coupled system is then dissected into partially coupled and uncoupled systems in order to quantify the effects of coupling. The simplicity of the model allows for analytic evaluation of many quantities of interest, including power spectra, total variance, lag covariance between atmosphere and ocean, and surface flux spectra. The model predicts that coupling between the atmosphere and ocean in the midlatitudes will enhance the variance in both media and will decrease the energy flux between the atmosphere and the ocean. The model also demonstrates that specification of historical midlatitude sea surface temperature anomalies as a boundary condition for an atmospheric model will not generally lead to a correct simulation of low-frequency atmospheric thermal variance. This model provides a simple conceptual framework for understanding the basic aspects of midlatitude coupled variability. Given the simplicity of the model, it agrees well with numerical simulations using a two-level atmospheric general circulation model coupled to a slab mixed layer ocean. The simple model results are also qualitatively consistent with the results obtained in several other studies in which investigators coupled realistic atmospheric general circulation models to ocean models of varying complexity. This suggests that the experimental design of an atmospheric model coupled to a mixed layer ocean model would provide a reasonable null hypothesis against which to rest for the presence of distinctive decadal variability.},

During the first step the pixels of a learning set are summarized by a set of codebook vectors using a Probabilistic Self-Organizing Map (PSOM, Statistique et methodes neuronales, Dunod, Paris, 1997). In a second step the codebook vectors of the map are clustered using Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC, Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1996). Each pixel takes the label of its nearest codebook vector. A practical application to Meteosat images illustrates the relevance of our approach.},

abstract = {New insight is provided regarding 21st century projections of synoptic scale atmospheric circulation over the New Zealand region. Daily mean sea level pressure patterns from a number of general circulation models (GCMs) participating in the 5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) were analysed through a self-organizing map (SOM) technique. In terms of simulating the synoptic climatology found in reanalyses, an initial model evaluation revealed quite substantial differences in model skill. Generally, those models with relatively high horizontal atmospheric resolution skilfully simulated the historical frequency and mean lifetime of large scale synoptic patterns over this region. Analysing future projections under this smaller subset of better-performing models indicated robust and quite substantial increases in the annual frequency of widespread anticyclonic conditions over New Zealand, accompanied by a general decrease in widespread low pressure. These projected changes in frequency of synoptic occurrences become the most pronounced towards the end of the 21st century and for winter, whereas changes in the average synoptic pattern lifetime remain small. While not robust for all models in this subset, significant 21st century trends in the intensification of geostrophic westerly flow conditions within certain synoptic patterns were also found. Linking synoptic patterns to surface climate variables has also provided evidence that these circulation changes may collectively manifest as a significant non-uniform climatic change across New Zealand. These findings should encourage further focused studies on circulation-relevant applications and impacts in a climate change context.},

@article{Gunter1951,
abstract = {The shallowness of Texas bay waters, their practically landlocked condition and the rapidity with which cold northers strike the coast are factors making the marine life of this area particularly subject to mortality from cold waves every few years. Since 1940 slight mortality was caused by cold waves in 1941 and 1949. Considerable damage was caused in 1947. The 1940 and 1951 episodes were catastrophic. Probably the 1940 instance was the most severe although the 1951 freeze was the hardest. Estimates made by biologists of the Game, Fish and Oyster Commission of the amount of fish killed in 1951 range from 60 million to 90 million pounds. It seems that if the damaging cold waves are preceded by other freezes, their destructive effect is lessened. Some animals escape to deeper water if the onset of the cold wave is slow and the rapidity with which the northers strike is a factor influencing the amount of mortality.},

Data from 113 climate stations for temperatures (mean, maximum and minimum) and total precipitation from 1951 to 1998 are used after standardizing with zero mean and unit variance, to confirm that all variables are weighted equally in the cluster analysis. Hierarchical cluster analysis is chosen to perform the regionalization. Five different techniques were applied initially to decide the most suitable method for the region. Stability of the clusters is also tested. It is decided that Ward's method is the most likely to yield acceptable results in this particular case, as is often the case in climatological research. Seven different climate zones are found, as in conventional climate zones, but with considerable differences at the boundaries. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2003 Royal Meteorological Society},

abstract = {One of the main characteristics of the Mediterranean climate is the irregular distribution of rainfalls and its high variability from year to year, which makes it difficult to know if Mediterranean rainfalls are changing. In this work, a combination of divisive (K-means algorithm) and hierarchical (average and Ward's methods) cluster techniques were used to analyse rainfall distribution patterns over the year and their changes over time. The study was performed using daily data (1889-1999) from the Alt Pened??s region (NE Spain), and annual, spring and autumn rainfall were analysed. The variables included in the cluster analysis were spring and autumn rainfalls, which represent on average 70{\%} of the annual rainfall. The K-means and Ward's methods led to similar classifications of the observations, whereas the average method had a lesser discrimination power. However, the combination of all of them was useful in the identification of the rainfall distribution patterns over the years and their changes with time. Patterns including dry springs and wet autumns have increased during the last decade, although any consistent trend in annual rainfall was not found. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Self organizing maps (SOMs) are used to locate archetypal points that describe the multi-dimensional distribution function of a gridded sea level pressure data set for the northeast United States. These points-nodes on the SOM-identify the primary features of the synoptic-scale circulation over the region. In effect, the nodes represent a non-linear distribution of overlapping, non-discreet, circulation types. The circulation patterns are readily visualized in a 2-dimensional array (the SOM) that places similar types adjacent to one another and very different types far apart in the SOM space. The SOM is used to describe synoptic circulation changes over time, and to relate the circulation to January station precipitation data (for State College, Pennsylvania) in the center of the domain. The paper focuses on the methodology; however, the analysis suggests that circulation systems that promote precipitation have decreased over the last 40 yr-although January precipitation at State College has actually increased. Further analysis with the SOM indicates that this is due to a change in precipitation characteristics of the synoptic-scale circulation features, rather than to their frequency of occurrence.},

abstract = {Identification of geographic ecoregions has long been of interest to environmental scientists and ecologists for identifying regions of similar ecological and environmental conditions. Such classifications are important for predicting suitable species ranges, for stratification of ecological samples, and to help prioritize habitat preservation and remediation efforts. Hargrove and Hoffman [1, 2] have developed geographical spatio-temporal clustering algorithms and codes and have successfully applied them to a variety of environmental science domains, including ecological regionalization; environmental monitoring network design; analysis of satellite-, airborne-, and ground-based remote sensing, and climate model-model and model-measurement intercomparison. With the advances in state-of-the-art satellite remote sensing and climate models, observations and model outputs are available at increasingly high spatial and temporal resolutions. Long time series of these high resolution datasets are extremely large in size and growing. Analysis and knowledge extraction from these large datasets are not just algorithmic and ecological problems, but also pose a complex computational problem. This paper focuses on the development of a massively parallel multivariate geographical spatio-temporal clustering code for analysis of very large datasets using tens of thousands processors on one of the fastest supercomputers in the world. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Hutchings2009,
abstract = {The Benguela system is one of the four major eastern boundary upwelling systems of the world. It is unusual as there are two stratified subtropical or warm temperate boundary regions, on either side of the major wind-driven upwelling region(19-34°S), which itself is subdivided at 26°S by the powerful Luderitz upwelling cell. Important biological components cross the boundary areas at different stages to complete the life-history cycle. While the "Bakun triad" of factors responsible for the development of large pelagic fish populations (enrichment, concentration and retention) provide an important unifying principle for understanding the compromise implicit in adaptation to upwelling systems, the role of predation has been neglected, as has the fish yield relative to photosynthesis. The role global climate change will have in the Benguela in terms of shifting boundaries or weakening or intensifying gradients is being explored. The interannual and decadal signals are so strong in the region that long term trends are difficult to distinguish. Intensive resource utilisation and the collapse of several fish stocks occurred in the Benguela region during the 1960s and 1970s, with different recovery trajectories in the north and the south. The Angolan subsystem can be described as a subtropical transition zone between the wind-driven upwelling system and the Equatorial Atlantic, with gentle upwelling-favourable winds, well-defined seasons, intermediate productivity and moderate, declining fisheries. It is separated from the Namibian subsystem by the Angola-Benguela front. The northern Benguela shelf is a typical coastal upwelling system with equatorward winds, cool water, high plankton biomass and moderate to high fish biomass, which is currently in a depleted state. A shift from sardines to horse mackerel occurred during the period 1970-1990, while hake have never fully recovered from intensive fishing pressure up to 1990. Widespread oxygen-depleted waters and sulphur eruptions result from local and remote forcing, restricting the habitat available for pelagic and demersal fish species. The Luderitz-Orange River Cone is an intensive perennial upwelling cell where strong winds, high turbulence and strong offshore transport constitute a partial barrier to epipelagic fish species. Upwelling source water alters in salinity and oxygen, across this boundary zone. A decline in upwelling-favourable winds occurred between 1990 and 2005. The southern Benguela region is characterised by a pulsed, seasonal, wind-driven upwelling at discrete centres and warm Agulhas water offshore. High primary productivity forms a belt of enrichment along the coast, constrained by a front. Low-oxygen water, which only occurs close inshore, may adversely affect some resources. The west coast is primarily a nursery ground for several fish species which spawn on the Agulhas Bank and are transported by alongshore jet currents to the west coast. The Agulhas Bank forms the southern boundary of the Benguela system and it displays characteristics of both an upwelling and a temperate shallow shelf system, with seasonal stratification and mixing, coastal, shelf-edge and dynamic upwelling, moderate productivity and a well oxygenated shelf. A large biomass of fish occupies the Bank during the summer season, with some evidence for tight coupling between trophic levels. A cool ridge of upwelled water, with links to coastal upwelling and to the Agulhas Current, appears to play an important but poorly understood role affecting the distribution and productivity of pelagic fish. A boom in sardine and anchovy populations was accompanied by an eastward shift, followed by 5 years of poor recruitment by sardine but successful recruitment of anchovy, indicating changes in the early life-history patterns of these two species. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The global temperature rose by 0.2 degrees C between the middle 1960's and 1980, yielding a warming of 0.4 degrees C in the past century. This temperature increase is consistent with the calculated greenhouse effect due to measured increases of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Variations of volcanic aerosols and possibly solar luminosity appear to be primary causes of observed fluctuations about the mean trend of increasing temperature. It is shown that the anthropogenic carbon dioxide warming should emerge from the noise level of natural climate variability by the end of the century, and there is a high probability of warming in the 1980's. Potential effects on climate in the 21st century include the creation of drought-prone regions in North America and central Asia as part of a shifting of climatic zones, erosion of the West Antarctic ice sheet with a consequent worldwide rise in sea level, and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage.},

abstract = {In austral summer 2011, an unprecedented Ningaloo Ni{\~{n}}o event occurred off the west coast of Australia, with sea surface temperature anomalies reaching 5. C and significant impacts on marine ecosystems. In this study, a high resolution ({\~{}}2. km) hydrodynamic model (Regional Ocean Modeling System) is used to simulate the variations in the near-surface temperature in the region from 2009 through mid-2011. Model results indicate that the peak temperatures in the broad mid-west coast of Australia during the event are predominantly due to poleward advection of warmer, tropical water (???2/3 contribution). In addition, positive air-sea heat flux into the ocean also contributes (???1/3 contribution) to the rise in temperature. The anomalous advection of warm water is caused by changes in the poleward flowing Leeuwin Current due to both local and remote wind forcing. In early 2011, the Leeuwin Current intensified owing to remote forcing by the equatorial easterly wind anomalies in the Pacific Ocean associated with the 2010-2011 La Ni{\~{n}}a. In addition, the southerly winds off the west coast of Australia weakened, allowing the Leeuwin Current to further intensify in speed at the peak of the event. Concurrently, the inshore, equatorward Capes Current was suppressed and reversed direction. The poleward flow over the shelf contributed to near-shore warming in contrast to cooling by upwelling and equatorward advection from the Capes Current in previous years.},

abstract = {Previous attempts to quantify topographic controls on vegetation have$\backslash$noften been frustrated by issues concerning the number of variables$\backslash$nof interest and the tendency of classification methods to create$\backslash$ndiscrete classes though species have overlapping property sets (niches).$\backslash$nMethods of fuzzy k-means classification have been used to address$\backslash$nclass overlap in ecological and geographical data but previously$\backslash$ntheir usefulness has been limited when data sets are large or include$\backslash$nartefacts that may occur through the derivation of topo-climatic$\backslash$nattributes from gridded digital elevation models. This paper presents$\backslash$nways to overcome these limitations using GIS, spatial sampling methods,$\backslash$nfuzzy k-means classification, and statistical modelling of the derived$\backslash$nstream topology. Using data from a ca. 3600 km2 forested site in$\backslash$nthe Greater Yellowstone Area, we demonstrate the creation of meaningful,$\backslash$nspatially coherent topo-climatic classes through a fuzzy k-means$\backslash$nclassification of topo-climatic data derived from 100 m gridded digital$\backslash$nelevation models (DEMs), these classes were successfully extrapolated$\backslash$nto adjacent areas covering a total of ca. 10 000 km2. Independently$\backslash$nderived land cover data and middle infrared corrected Landsat TM$\backslash$nderived estimates of Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (M{\_}NDVI)$\backslash$nat 575 independently sampled sites were used to evaluate the topo-climatic$\backslash$nclasses and test their extrapolation to the larger area. Relations$\backslash$nbetween topo-climatic classes and land cover were tested by x2 analysis$\backslash$nwhich demonstrated strong associations between topo-climatic class$\backslash$nand 11 of the 15 cover classes. Relations between M{\_}NDVI and topo-climatic$\backslash$nclasses proved to be stronger than relations between M{\_}NDVI and the$\backslash$nindependent cover classes.We conclude that the fuzzy k-means procedure$\backslash$nyields sensible and stable topo-climatic classes that can be used$\backslash$nfor the rapid mapping of large areas. The value of$\backslash$n$\backslash$nthesemethods for quantifying topographic controls on biodiversity$\backslash$nand the strength of their relationswith computed NDVI values warrant$\backslash$nfurther investigation.},

Recent findings suggest that Agulhas leakage is a crucial component of the climate system and that ongoing increases in leakage under anthropogenic warming could strengthen the Atlantic overturning circulation at a time when warming and accelerated meltwater input in the North Atlantic is predicted to weaken it. Yet in comparison with processes in the North Atlantic, the overall Agulhas system is largely overlooked as a potential climate trigger or feedback mechanism. Detailed modelling experiments--backed by palaeoceanographic and sustained modern observations--are required to establish firmly the role of the Agulhas system in a warming climate.},

abstract = {Late in summer 2003, extensive mass mortality of at least 25 rocky benthic macro-invertebrate species (mainly gorgonians and sponges) was observed in the entire Northwestern (NW) Mediterranean region, affecting several thousand kilometers of coastline. We were able to characterize the mortality event by studying six areas covering the main regions of the NW Mediterranean basin. The degree of impact on each study area was quantified at 49 sites by estimating the proportion of colonies affected in populations of several gorgonian species compared with reference data obtained in years without mortality signs. According to these data, the western areas (Catalan coast and Balearic Islands) were the least affected, while the central areas (Provence coast and Corsica-Sardinia) showed a moderate impact. The northernmost and eastern areas (Gulf of Genoa and Gulf of Naples) displayed the highest impact, with almost 80{\%} of gorgonian colonies affected. The heat wave of 2003 in Europe caused an anomalous warming of seawater, which reached the highest temperatures ever recorded in the studied regions, between 1 and 3 °C above the climatic values (mean and maximum). Because this exceptional warming was observed in the depth ranges most affected by the mortality, it seems likely that the 2003 anomalous temperature played a key role in the observed mortality event. A correlation analysis between temperature conditions and degree of impact seems to support this hypothesis. Under the present climate warming trend, new mass mortality events may occur in the near future, possibly driving a major biodiversity crisis in the Mediterranean Sea.},

@article{Sang2008a,
abstract = {Self-organizing maps (SOMs) are a technique that has been used with high-dimensional data vectors to develop an archetypal set of states (nodes) that span, in some sense, the high-dimensional space. Noteworthy applications include weather states as described by weather variables over a region and speech patterns as characterized by frequencies in time. The SOM approach is essentially a neural network model that implements a nonlinear projection from a high-dimensional input space to a low-dimensional array of neurons. In the process, it also becomes a clustering technique, assigning to any vector in the high-dimensional data space the node (neuron) to which it is closest (using, say, Euclidean distance) in the data space. The number of nodes is thus equal to the number of clusters. However, the primary use for the SOM is as a representation technique, that is, finding a set of nodes which representatively span the high-dimensional space. These nodes are typically displayed using maps to enable visualization of the continuum of the data space. The technique does not appear to have been discussed in the statistics literature so it is our intent here to bring it to the attention of the community. The technique is implemented algorithmically through a training set of vectors. However, through the introduction of stochasticity in the form of a space--time process model, we seek to illuminate and interpret its performance in the context of application to daily data collection. That is, the observed daily state vectors are viewed as a time series of multivariate process realizations which we try to understand under the dimension reduction achieved by the SOM procedure.},

Examples include SST fluctuations in the Southern Ocean associated with the Southern Annular Mode, a tripolar pattern of SST anomalies in the North Atlantic associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation, and a pan-Pacific mode known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (with additional contributions from oceanic processes). They may also result from coupled ocean-atmosphere interactions, such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon in the tropical Indo-Pacific, the tropical Atlantic Nino, and the cross-equatorial meridional modes ill the tropical Pacific and Atlantic. Finally, patterns of SST variability may arise from intrinsic oceanic modes, notably the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation.},

abstract = {Record high ocean temperatures were experienced along the Western Australian coast during the austral summer of 2010/2011. Satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in February 2011 peaked at 3. ??C above the long-term monthly means over a wide area from Ningaloo (22??S) to Cape Leeuwin (34??S) along the coast and out to {\textgreater}200km offshore. Hourly temperature measurements at a number of mooring sites along the coast revealed that the temperature anomalies were mostly trapped in the surface mixed layer, with peak nearshore temperatures rising to {\~{}}. 5. ??C above average in the central west coastal region over a week encompassing the end of February and early March, resulting in some devastating fish kills as well as temporary southward range extensions of tropical fish species and megafauna such as whale sharks and manta rays. The elevated temperatures were a result of a combination of a record strength Leeuwin Current, a near-record La Ni??a event, and anomalously high air-sea heat flux into the ocean even though the SST was high. This heat wave was an unprecedented thermal event in Western Australian waters, superimposed on an underlying long-term temperature rise. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Organizing data into sensible groupings is one of the most fundamental modes of understanding and learning. As an example, a common scheme of scientific classification puts organisms into a system of ranked taxa: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, etc. Cluster analysis is the formal study of methods and algorithms for grouping, or clustering, objects according to measured or perceived intrinsic characteristics or similarity. Cluster analysis does not use category labels that tag objects with prior identifiers, i.e., class labels. The absence of category information distinguishes data clustering (unsupervised learning) from classification or discriminant analysis (supervised learning). The aim of clustering is to find structure in data and is therefore exploratory in nature. Clustering has a long and rich history in a variety of scientific fields. One of the most popular and simple clustering algorithms, K-means, was first published in 1955. In spite of the fact that K-means was proposed over 50 years ago and thousands of clustering algorithms have been published since then, K-means is still widely used. This speaks to the difficulty in designing a general purpose clustering algorithm and the ill-posed problem of clustering. We provide a brief overview of clustering, summarize well known clustering methods, discuss the major challenges and key issues in designing clustering algorithms, and point out some of the emerging and useful research directions, including semi-supervised clustering, ensemble clustering, simultaneous feature selection during data clustering, and large scale data clustering. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {It is now widely recognized that El Ni{\~{}} no–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) occurs in more than one form, with the canonical eastern Pacific (EP) and more recently recognized central Pacific (CP) ENSO types receiving the most focus. Given that these variousENSO‘‘flavors'' may contribute to climate variability and long-term trends in unique ways, and that ENSO variability is not limited to these two types, this study presents a framework that treats ENSO as a continuum but determines a finite maximum number of statistically distinguishable representativeENSOpatterns.Aneural network–based cluster analysis called self-organizing map (SOM) analysis paired with a statistical distinguishability test determines nine unique patterns that characterize the September–February tropical Pacific SST anomaly fields for the period from 1950 through 2011. These nine patterns represent the flavors of ENSO, which include EP, CP, and mixed ENSO patterns. Over the 1950–2011 period, the most significant trends reflect changes in La Ni{\~{}} na patterns, with a shift in dominance of La Ni{\~{}} na–like patterns with weak or negative western Pacific warm pool SST anomalies until the mid-1970s, followed by a dominance of La Ni{\~{}} na–like patterns with positive western Pacific warm pool SST anomalies, particularly after the mid-1990s. Both an EP and especially a CP El Ni{\~{}} no pattern experienced positive frequency trends,but these trends are indistinguishable fromnatural variability.Overall, changes infrequencywithin the ENSOcontinuum contributed to the pattern of tropical Pacific warming, particularly in the equatorial eastern Pacific and especially in relation to changes of La Ni{\~{}} na–like rather than El Ni{\~{}} no–like patterns.},

abstract = {The transport of warm and salty Indian Ocean waters into the Atlantic Ocean-the Agulhas leakage-has a crucial role in the global oceanic circulation and thus the evolution of future climate. At present these waters provide the main source of heat and salt for the surface branch of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC). There is evidence from past glacial-to-interglacial variations in foraminiferal assemblages and model studies that the amount of Agulhas leakage and its corresponding effect on the MOC has been subject to substantial change, potentially linked to latitudinal shifts in the Southern Hemisphere westerlies. A progressive poleward migration of the westerlies has been observed during the past two to three decades and linked to anthropogenic forcing, but because of the sparse observational records it has not been possible to determine whether there has been a concomitant response of Agulhas leakage. Here we present the results of a high-resolution ocean general circulation model to show that the transport of Indian Ocean waters into the South Atlantic via the Agulhas leakage has increased during the past decades in response to the change in wind forcing. The increased leakage has contributed to the observed salinification of South Atlantic thermocline waters. Both model and historic measurements off South America suggest that the additional Indian Ocean waters have begun to invade the North Atlantic, with potential implications for the future evolution of the MOC.},

Lattice models have been used to investigate how hypothetical species with different characteristics respond to habitat loss. The main result shows that a sharp threshold in habitat availability exists below which a species rapidly becomes extinct. Here, a similar modelling approach is taken to establish what determines how species respond to climate change. A similar threshold exists for the rate of climate change as has been observed for habitat loss-patch occupancy remains high up to a critical rate of climate change, beyond which species extinction becomes likely. Habitat specialists, especially those of relatively poor colonizing ability are least able to keep pace with climate change. The interaction between climate change and habitat loss might be disastrous. During climate change, the habitat threshold occurs sooner. Similarly, species suffer more from climate change in a fragmented habitat.},

We used two measures of thermal shifts from analyses of global temperatures over the past 50 years to describe the pace of climate change that species should track: the velocity of climate change (geographic shifts of isotherms over time) and the shift in seasonal timing of temperatures. Both measures are higher in the ocean than on land at some latitudes, despite slower ocean warming. These indices give a complex mosaic of predicted range shifts and phenology changes that deviate from simple poleward migration and earlier springs or later falls. They also emphasize potential conservation concerns, because areas of high marine biodiversity often have greater velocities of climate change and seasonal shifts.},

Using projections of species' distributions for future climate scenarios, we assess extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20{\%} of the Earth's terrestrial surface. Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a power-law relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15-37{\%} of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be 'committed to extinction'. When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction approximately 18{\%}) than mid-range approximately 24{\%}) and maximum-change approximately 35{\%}) scenarios.

Understanding the climatic drivers of this extreme event, which we dub "Ningaloo Ni{\~{n}}o", is crucial for predicting similar events under the influence of global warming. Here we use observational data and numerical models to demonstrate that the extreme warming was mostly driven by an unseasonable surge of the poleward-flowing Leeuwin Current in austral summer, which transported anomalously warm water southward along the coast. The unusual intensification of the Leeuwin Current was forced remotely by oceanic and atmospheric teleconnections associated with the extraordinary 2010-2011 La Ni{\~{n}}a.

abstract = {Despite their adverse impacts, definitions and measurements of heat waves are ambiguous and inconsistent, generally being endemic to only the group affected, or the respective study reporting the analysis. The present study addresses this issue by employing a set of three heat wave definitions, derived from surveying heat- related indices in the climate science literature. The definitions include three or more consecutive days above one of the following: the 90th percentile for maximum temperature, the 90th percentile for minimum tem- perature, and positive extreme heat factor (EHF) conditions. Additionally, each index is studied using a multiaspect framework measuring heat wave number, duration, participating days, and the peak and mean magnitudes. Observed climatologies and trends computed by Sen's Kendall slope estimator are presented for the Australian continent for two time periods (1951–2008 and 1971–2008). Trends in all aspects and definitions are smaller in magnitude but more significant for 1951–2008 than for 1971–2008. Considerable similarities exist in trends of the yearly number of days participating in a heat wave and yearly heat wave frequency, suggesting that the number of available heat wave days drives the number of events. Larger trends in the hottest part of a heat wave suggest that heat wave intensity is increasing faster than the mean mag- nitude. Although the direct results of this study cannot be inferred for other regions, the methodology has been designed as such that it is widely applicable. Furthermore, it includes a range of definitions that may be useful for a wide range of systems impacted by heat waves.},

abstract = {Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have been observed around the world and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency under anthropogenic climate change. A variety of impacts have been associated with these anomalous events, including shifts in species ranges, local extinctions and economic impacts on seafood industries through declines in important fishery species and impacts on aquaculture. Extreme temperatures are increasingly seen as important influences on biological systems, yet a consistent definition of MHWs does not exist. A clear definition will facilitate retrospective comparisons between MHWs, enabling the synthesis and a mechanistic understanding of the role of MHWs in marine ecosystems. Building on research into atmospheric heatwaves, we propose both a general and specific definition for MHWs, based on a hierarchy of metrics that allow for different data sets to be used in identifying MHWs. We generally define a MHW as a prolonged discrete anomalously warm water event that can be described by its duration, intensity, rate of evolution, and spatial extent. Specifically, we consider an anomalously warm event to be a MHW if it lasts for five or more days, with temperatures warmer than the 90th percentile based on a 30-year historical baseline period. This structure provides flexibility with regard to the description of MHWs and transparency in communicating MHWs to a general audience. The use of these metrics is illustrated for three 21st century MHWs; the northern Mediterranean event in 2003, the Western Australia ‘Ningaloo Ni{\~{n}}o' in 2011, and the northwest Atlantic event in 2012. We recommend a specific quantitative definition for MHWs to facilitate global comparisons and to advance our understanding of these phenomena.},

Small-area anomalies occur more frequently than large-area anomalies, and this relationship can be characterized by a power-law distribution. The relative frequency of large- versus small-area anomalies, represented by the power-law slope parameter, is modulated by basin-scale modes of natural climate variability and anthropogenic warming. Findings suggest that the probability of marine heatwaves is a trade-off between size, intensity and duration, and that region specific variability modulates the statistical attributes of these events.},

A rainy pattern is clearly identified with a probability of rain of 74.6{\%}, as well as two distinct dry patterns, one prevailing in summer and the other occurring frequently in winter; a blocking-like pattern with a probability of rain of 36.8{\%} has also been identified. These patterns are quasi-stationary, normally persisting for 1 week and sometimes even for 1 month, especially the dry ones; they represent the principal weather regimes associated with precipitation in Portugal. Interannual variations in monthly precipitation associated with the circulation patterns are also investigated; results show that these variations match fluctuations in the frequencies of occurrence of both the rainy and the dry patterns. The decreasing trend of March monthly rainfall in southern Portugal is closely related to corresponding trends in the frequencies of both the rainy pattern and the summer dry pattern. Long term trends are not significant either in other monthly rainfall sequences or in the frequencies of different circulation patterns. Interannual variations seem, in most months, to be quasi-periodic. Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is performed on these sequences to detect quasi-periodic oscillations. Relationships between oscillations in rainfall and in frequencies of occurrence of circulation patterns are studied. Results show that four weather circulation patterns or weather regimes are important for investigating regional climate change in Portugal and its relationship with variability of large-scale atmospheric circulation. {\textcopyright} 1998 Royal Meteorological Society},

abstract = {Climate models are our principal tool for generating the projections used to inform climate change policy. Our confidence in projections depends, in part, on how realistically they simulate present day climate and associated variability over a range of time scales. Traditionally, climate models are less commonly assessed at time scales relevant to daily weather systems. Here we explore the utility of a self-organizing maps (SOMs) procedure for evaluating the frequency, persistence and transitions of daily synoptic systems in the Australian region simulated by state-of-the-art global climate models. In terms of skill in simulating the climatological frequency of synoptic systems, large spread was observed between models. A positive association between all metrics was found, implying that relative skill in simulating the persistence and transitions of systems is related to skill in simulating the climatological frequency. Considering all models and metrics collectively, model performance was found to be related to model horizontal resolution but unrelated to vertical resolution or representation of the stratosphere. In terms of the SOM procedure, the timespan over which evaluation was performed had some influence on model performance skill measures, as did the number of circulation types examined. These findings have implications for selecting models most useful for future projections over the Australian region, particularly for projections related to synoptic scale processes and phenomena. More broadly, this study has demonstrated the utility of the SOMs procedure in providing a process-based evaluation of climate models.},

abstract = {The theory of fuzzy sets is discussed as a possible way of dealing with the continuity of climatic data. The method of fuzzy c-means is described in detail and used to create fuzzy groups for two sets of climatic data, one from Australia and the other from China. The resulting groups seem intuitively reasonable, showing the inherent continuity of the data and a reasonable geographical contiguity. The problem of choosing c (the number of groups) and m (the degree of fuzziness) simultaneously remains unsolved. Measures of fuzziness, which have been used by some authors to estimate c given m, give rise to heuristic arguments which ignore the question of "what is a group?". Some authors have assumed that large jumps in membership functions indicate levels at which natural groupings occur in data. An attempt experimentally to gain some agreement between standard measures of fuzziness and this approach, which agrees with that expected by intuition in a simple example, has led to a cursory yet promising approach to this problem. The fuzzy sets approach is realistic and flexible, and may offer a better approach to information transfer than does the classification of climate into discrete sets. The initial problems of accepting the notion of formal fuzzy classification and of perception of fuzzy classes, once established, appear from the authors' experience to be transient. ?? 1985.},

abstract = {The continued increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide due to anthropogenic emissions is predicted to lead to significant changes in climate. About half of the current emissions are being absorbed by the ocean and by land ecosystems, but this absorption is sensitive to climate as well as to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, creating a feedback loop. General circulation models have generally excluded the feedback between climate and the biosphere, using static vegetation distributions and CO2 concentrations from simple carbon-cycle models that do not include climate change. Here we present results from a fully coupled, three-dimensional carbon-climate model, indicating that carbon-cycle feedbacks could significantly accelerate climate change over the twenty-first century. We find that under a 'business as usual' scenario, the terrestrial biosphere acts as an overall carbon sink until about 2050, but turns into a source thereafter. By 2100, the ocean uptake rate of 5 Gt C yr(-1) is balanced by the terrestrial carbon source, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations are 250 p.p.m.v. higher in our fully coupled simulation than in uncoupled carbon models, resulting in a global-mean warming of 5.5 K, as compared to 4 K without the carbon-cycle feedback.},

abstract = {Gridded SST products developed particularly for offshore regions are increasingly being applied close to the coast for biogeographical applications. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the dangers of doing so through a comparison of reprocessed MODIS Terra and Pathfinder v5.2 SSTs, both at 4 km resolution, with instrumental in situ temperatures taken within 400 m from the coast. We report large biases of up to +6°C in places between satellite-derived and in situ climatological temperatures for 87 sites spanning the entire ca. 2 700 km of the South African coastline. Although biases are predominantly warm (i.e. the satellite SSTs being higher), smaller or even cold biases also appear in places, especially along the southern and western coasts of the country. We also demonstrate the presence of gradients in temperature biases along shore-normal transects - generally SSTs extracted close to the shore demonstrate a smaller bias with respect to the in situ temperatures. Contributing towards the magnitude of the biases are factors such as SST data source, proximity to the shore, the presence/absence of upwelling cells or coastal embayments. Despite the generally large biases, from a biogeographical perspective, species distribution retains a correlative relationship with underlying spatial patterns in SST, but in order to arrive at a causal understanding of the determinants of biogeographical patterns we suggest that in shallow, inshore marine habitats, temperature is best measured directly.},

abstract = {The mechanisms that contribute to the generation and damping of large-scale mid-latitude sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are discussed. The SST anomalies reflect primarily the response of the upper ocean to the changes in air-sea fluxes that are associated with daily weather fluctuations. Heat flux forcing is dominant in the lower middle latitudes, while wind-driven entrainment may be most effective in the high latitudes; advection by anomalous Ekman current is generally less important, and Ekman pumping is negligible. The SST anomalies decay in part because of entrainment effects associated with mixed-layer deepening and oceanic mixing and in part because of heat exchanges with the atmosphere. The three approaches commonly used to model the evolution of SST anomalies are reviewed: case studies based on monthly or seasonal anomaly maps of the large-scale SST and atmospheric anomalies, numerical simulations with one-dimensional mixed-layer models, and stochastic forcing models. We stress the similarities in the different approaches and discuss their main advantages and limitations. The response of the atmosphere to mid-latitude SST anomalies is considered. First, we discuss the poorly known relationship between SST anomalies and diabatic heating. Using a crude assumption for the air-sea coupling, we consider a two-layer quasi-geostrophic channel model and discuss the stationary wave response to SST anomaly forcing and the resulting air-sea feedback. It is found that the back interaction of the SST anomalies onto the atmosphere causes a weak SST anomaly damping at large scales and a strong one at small scales; the air-sea coupling should also act as an eastward propagator for the SST anomalies. The response of more realistic linear wave models to prescribed diabatic heating is then reviewed, and it is suggested that realistic mid-latitude SST anomalies have a weak influence on the atmospheric circulation, corresponding to changes in the geopotential height of 10–30 m at most. This order of magnitude is consistent with the results of general circulation model experiments and with the limited climate predictability associated with mid-latitude SST anomalies.},

In early 2011, the marine ecosystems along the west coast of Australia—a global hotspot of biodiversity and endemism—experienced the highest-magnitude warming event on record. Sea temperatures soared to unprecedented levels and warming anomalies of 2–4 ◦C persisted for more than ten weeks along {\textgreater}2,000km of coastline. We show that biodiversity patterns of temperate seaweeds, sessile invertebrates and demersal fish were significantly different after the warming event, which led to a reduction in the abundance of habitat-forming seaweeds and a subsequent shift in community structure towards a depauperate state and a tropicalization of fish communities. We conclude that extreme climatic events are key drivers of biodiversity patterns and that the frequency and intensity of such episodes have major implications for predictive models of species distribution and ecosystemstructure, which are largely based on gradualwarming trends.},

abstract = {Using a non-linear statistical analysis called "self-organizing maps", the interannual sea surface temperature (SST) variations in the southern Indian Ocean are investigated. The SST anomalies during austral summer from 1951 to 2006 are classified into nine types with differences in the position of positive and negative SST anomaly poles. To investigate the evolution of these SST anomaly poles, heat budget analysis of mixed-layer using outputs from an ocean general circulation model is conducted. The warming of the mixed-layer by the climatological shortwave radiation is enhanced (suppressed) as a result of negative (positive) mixed-layer thickness anomaly over the positive (negative) SST anomaly pole. This contribution from shortwave radiation is most dominant in the growth of SST anomalies. In contrast to the results reported so far, the contribution from latent heat flux anomaly is not so important. The discrepancy in the analysis is explained by the modulation in the contribution from the climatological heat flux by the interannual mixed-layer depth anomaly that was neglected in the past studies. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

Also, the surface equilibrium temperature of the former is almost twice as sensitive to change of various factors such as solar constant, CO2 content, O3 content, and cloudiness, than that of the latter, due to the adjustment of water vapor content to the temperature variation of the atmosphere.

abstract = {Temperate Australia is a global hotspot for marine biodiversity and its waters have experienced well-above global average rates of ocean warming. We review the observed impacts of climate change (e.g. warming, ocean acidification, changes in storm patterns) on subtidal temperate coasts in Australia and assess how these systems are likely to respond to further change. Observed impacts are region specific with the greatest number of species responses attributable to climate change reported in south-eastern Australia, where recent ocean warming has been most pronounced. Here, a decline of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) and poleward range extension of a key herbivore (sea urchin) and other trophically important reef organisms has occurred. Although, evidence of changes on other coastlines around Australia is limited, we suggest that this is due to a lack of data rather than lack of change. Because of the east-west orientation of the south coast, most of Australia's temperate waters are found within a narrow latitudinal band, where any southward movement of isotherms is likely to affect species across very large areas. Future increases in temperature are likely to result in further range shifts of macroalgae and associated species, with range contractions and local extinctions to be expected for species that have their northern limits along the southern coastline. While there is currently no evidence of changes attributable to non-temperature related climate impacts, potentially due to a lack of long-term observational data, experimental evidence suggests that ocean acidification will result in negative effects on calcifying algae and animals. More importantly, recent experiments suggest the combined effects of climate change and non-climate stressors (overharvesting, reduced water quality) will lower the resilience of temperate marine communities to perturbations (e.g. storms, diseases, and introduced species), many of which are also predicted to increase in frequency and/or severity. Thus climate change is likely to, both by itself and in synergy with other stressors, impose change to southern Australian coastal species, including important habitat-forming algae and the associated ecological functioning of temperate coasts. Management of local and regional-scale stresses may increase the resistance of temperate marine communities to climate stressors and as such, provides an attractive tool for building resilience in temperate systems. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Many small clusters are concentrated in the Pacific Northwest. The 25-cluster solution can be used to identify the subzones within the 14 clusters. At that more detailed level, many of the areally more extensive clusters are partitioned into smaller, more internally cohesive subgroups.

Over recent years, progress has been made in understanding both the causes of and changes to heatwaves. Relationships between atmospheric heatwaves and large-scale and synoptic variability have been identified, with increasing trends in heatwave intensity, frequency and duration projected to continue throughout the 21st century. However, more research is required to further our understanding of the dynamical interactions of atmospheric heatwaves, particularly with the land surface. Research into marine heatwaves is still in its infancy, with little known about driving mechanisms, and observed and future changes. In order to address these knowledge gaps, recommendations include: focusing on a comprehensive assessment of atmospheric heatwave dynamics; understanding links with droughts; working towards a unified measurement framework; and investigating observed and future trends in marine heatwaves. Such work requires comprehensive and long-term collaboration activities.

abstract = {One of the major concerns with a potential change in climate is that an increase in extreme events will occur. Results of observational studies suggest that in many areas that have been analyzed, changes in total precipitation are amplified at the tails, and changes in some temperature extremes have been observed. Model output has been analyzed that shows changes in extreme events for future climates, such as increases in extreme high temperatures, decreases in extreme low temperatures, and increases in intense precipitation events. In addition, the societal infrastructure is becoming more sensitive to weather and climate extremes, which would be exacerbated by climate change. In wild plants and animals, climate-induced extinctions, distributional and phenological changes, and species' range shifts are being documented at an increasing rate. Several apparently gradual biological changes are linked to responses to extreme weather and climate events.},

@article{Hewitson2002,
abstract = {ABSTRACT: Self organizing maps (SOMs) are used to locate archetypal points that describe the multi-dimensional distribution function of a gridded sea level pressure data set for the northeast United States. These points�nodes on the SOM�identify the primary features of the synoptic-scale circulation over the region. In effect, the nodes represent a non-linear distribution of overlapping, non-discreet, circulation types. The circulation patterns are readily visualized in a 2-dimensional array (the SOM) that places similar types adjacent to one another and very different types far apart in the SOM space. The SOM is used to describe synoptic circulation changes over time, and to relate the circulation to January station precipitation data (for State College, Pennsylvania) in the center of the domain. The paper focuses on the methodology; however, the analysis suggests that circulation systems that promote precipitation have decreased over the last 40 yr�although January precipitation at State College has actually increased. Further analysis with the SOM indicates that this is due to a change in precipitation characteristics of the synoptic-scale circulation features, rather than to their frequency of occurrence.},

@article{Chao2009a,
abstract = {A two-dimensional variational data assimilation (2DVAR) method for blending sea surface temperature (SST) data from multiple observing platforms is presented. This method produces continuous fields and has the capability of blending multiple satellite and in situ observations. In addition, it allows specification of inhomogeneous and anisotropic background correlations, which are common features of coastal ocean flows. High-resolution 6 km in space and 6 h in time) blended SST fields for August 2003 are produced for a region off the California coast to demonstrate and evaluate the methodology. A comparison of these fields with independent observations showed root-mean-square errors of less than 1 degrees C, comparable to the errors in conventional SST observations. The blended SST fields also clearly reveal the finescale spatial and temporal structures associated with coastal upwelling, demonstrating their utility in the analysis of finescale flows. With the high temporal resolution, the blended SST fields are also used to describe the diurnal cycle. Potential applications of this SST blending methodology in other coastal regions are discussed.},

@article{Sang2008,
abstract = {Self-organizing maps (SOMs) are a technique that has been used with high-dimensional data vectors to develop an archetypal set of states (nodes) that span, in some sense, the high-dimensional space. Noteworthy applications include weather states as described by weather variables over a region and speech patterns as characterized by frequencies in time. The SOM approach is essentially a neural network model that implements a nonlinear projection from a high-dimensional input space to a low-dimensional array of neurons. In the process, it also becomes a clustering technique, assigning to any vector in the high-dimensional data space the node (neuron) to which it is closest (using, say, Euclidean distance) in the data space. The number of nodes is thus equal to the number of clusters. However, the primary use for the SOM is as a representation technique, that is, finding a set of nodes which representatively span the high-dimensional space. These nodes are typically displayed using maps to enable visualization of the continuum of the data space. The technique does not appear to have been discussed in the statistics literature so it is our intent here to bring it to the attention of the community. The technique is implemented algorithmically through a training set of vectors. However, through the introduction of stochasticity in the form of a space--time process model, we seek to illuminate and interpret its performance in the context of application to daily data collection. That is, the observed daily state vectors are viewed as a time series of multivariate process realizations which we try to understand under the dimension reduction achieved by the SOM procedure.},
