  # Lolliplots

# Summary/stats table


# Figure 2 ----------------------------------------------------------------

# A synthesis of the three tests: length, missing, trended
# The tests are all the same and the three things investigated were
  # climatologies: KS tests
  # event metrics: ANOVA/Tukey
  # category count: chi-squared/residuals
# I envision here some sort of figure that compares the results side by side
# while highlighting how as the degridation of the three tests increases
# how much more rapidly this effects the results than the other tests
# Currently this is being shown with line plots but they aren't popular...

# This figure would likely be the climatology results only


# Figure 3 ----------------------------------------------------------------

# This figure would likely be the event results only


# Figure 4 ----------------------------------------------------------------

# This figure would likely be the cagtegory results only


# Figure 5 ----------------------------------------------------------------

# I imagine this figure being something that supports an argument that follows
# on from one of the above results
# Specifically I think this figure will be the one that shows the average count
# of consecutive missing days depending on the percent of missing data


# Figure 6 ----------------------------------------------------------------

# A sixth figure would be a bit much, but it may be useful to show some sort
# of meta-analysis here
# Such as the relationships between increasing tests and aspects of the time series
# To that end though if such a thing is to be investiagated it would be better
# to run the glbal analysis and show that
