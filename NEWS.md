# MHWdetection 0.0.4  (2019-01-24)

* Looking over skeleton of main text

  * The calculations otherwise still remained the same

# MHWdetection 0.0.4  (2019-01-23)

* Performed a deep dive on the issues around missing data and the quantile thresholds
    * Must look at step-by-step process in Python code to determine the issue

# MHWdetection 0.0.4  (2019-01-17)

* Checked that R and Python base results still match up after heatwaveR v0.3.6 release
    * The threshold calculations appear to be affected differently by large amounts of missing data

* Recompiled vignettes

# MHWdetection 0.0.3  (2018-09-13)

* Finished up initially proposed work on `missing_data.Rmd`
* Rebuilt site to reflect upversion to v0.0.3

# MHWdetection 0.0.2  (2018-09-11)

* Minor additions

# MHWdetection 0.0.2  (2018-09-10)

* Further editing to `time_series_duration.Rmd`

# MHWdetection 0.0.2  (2018-09-06)

* Finished preliminary random missing data results
* Fixed CI issues with short time series vignette

# MHWdetection 0.0.2  (2018-09-05)

* Further editing to `time_series_duration.Rmd`
* Began writing `missing_data.Rmd`
* Rebuilt site to host changes

# MHWdetection 0.0.2  (2018-09-03)

* Added AJS and ECJO feedback into `MHWdetection.Rmd`
* Added AJS and ECJO feedback into `time_series_duration.Rmd`

# MHWdetection 0.0.2  (2018-06-21)

* More in-depths category comparisons made

# MHWdetection 0.0.2  (2018-06-16)

* Some pre-emptive thoughts about more category comparisons

# MHWdetection 0.0.2  (2018-06-13)

* Finished up basic comparisons of categories for different clim periods

# MHWdetection 0.0.2  (2018-06-12)

* Added significance tests for clims of different lengths for both single and re-sampled clims

# MHWdetection 0.0.2  (2018-06-07)
